For full model finetuning use tts_finetune.ipynb and install environment.yaml file(also download the libraries mentioned in comments). For completion of this code, this hugging face sample code was used as a starting point. https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter6/fine-tuning  

For embedding finetuning, navigate to speaker_embeddings_ft folder, install the environment.yaml file, and run embedding_ft_final.ipynb
